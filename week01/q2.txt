The downside to vim is that it is difficult to get started, but once you do it can be an amazing tool. providing great features and options to do things that fit your unique situations you'll come across when coding. I don't have to worry about that initial learning curve (or wall) because it was the first linux editor I had been trained on. Programmers at my work showed me how to edit and code on Linux (just some simple stuff), and they showed me with vim. While I am still far away from mastery it is the tool I feel most comfortable with right now.
